Abstract
</summary>

Access to finance remains a major constraint for many firms despite the
potential of Sub-Saharan Africa's clean energy sector to the drive the
continent's energy transition and access goals. This paper investigates
the key factors influencing the bankability of clean energy projects in Ghana
using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The study
examines five latent variables: project readiness, financial structures,
experienced project teams, risk mitigation, and alignment with Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGS) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
criteria. A survey was administered to 80 respondents comprising clean energy
companies, policymakers, and financiers. The PLS-SEM approach was used to
identify significant relationships between these variables and the overall
bankability of projects. Our findings show that bankability is multidimensional
and determined by a combination of direct project enablers and indirect
interdependencies. Projects are more likely to be bankable if they have clear
regulatory approvals, defined objectives, and undertaken feasibility studies,
along with thorough financial modelling. Experienced teams, strong stakeholder
support, and robust risk mitigation strategies also enhance bankability. While
SDG-ESG alignment is increasingly important, it plays a supporting rather than
central role in securing clean energy project financing. The findings provide
practical insights for policymakers, clean energy developers and financiers in
Ghana and other emerging economies.

**_The Global Health Burden from Coal-fired Power Stations_** with [Sugandha Srivastav](https://www.sugandhasrivastav.com/). *WP coming soon*

Abstract
</summary>

The advent of spatially disaggregated data allows to us map
where coal and gas fired power plants are located with unprecedented precision.
Leveraging this data, we calculate the global health burden urban populations
that live in proximity to fossil-fueled power plants. We first investigate how
much of global fossil-fueled energy generation capacity is located within
25km from population centres, followed by a quantification of the people
potentially exposed to the resultant pollution. Lastly, we estimate the total
life years lost as a result of proximity to coal- and gas-fired power plants.

Abstract
</summary>
In light of the growing climate and non-climate related
pressures on the global food system, this paper addresses three related questions:
To what extent do global food price shocks pass through to local markets, how
are these pass-throughs conditioned by country-level idiosyncrasies, and can
fiscal policy effectively support shock response and longer-term price
stabilisation? We estimate global-to-local food price pass-throughs in a
Bayesian VAR for most countries in the world using publicly available data
sources. To further investigate cross-dependencies in vulnerable countries,
our model is then extended to include multiple covariate shocks for the
Sub-Saharan African sub-sample. Decomposing food price shocks over time,
space, and contemporaneous oil price and harvest shocks, we construct fiscal
policy counterfactuals to evaluate hypothetical coping strategies.

**_Exposure to Deforestation: How Robust is Statistical Inference to Choices in Land Cover Modelling?_** with [Stafford Nichols](https://unu.edu/merit/about/research-fellow/stafford-nichols) and [Stephan Dietrich](https://unu.edu/merit/about/expert/dr-stephan-dietrich).

Abstract
</summary>
Earth observation data has greatly enriched social science research, especially in contexts
where data is otherwise scarce or likely to suffer from measurement error. However,
social scientists may not have a good enough understanding of remote sensing
techniques to avoid unforeseen side effects when using this type of data. Economists
often combine gridded land cover data with survey data by reducing the former to locally
centred summary statistics at the interview locations provided by the latter. The
decisions taken in this reduction process can affect the resulting exposure metric and
subsequent statistical inference. Using interview locations in eleven African countries
from a large international survey, we calculate respondents' exposure to deforestation
in 108 slightly different ways. To illustrate how this can affect inference, we model
respondents' subjective well-being scores on the different versions of their exposure
to local deforestation in a multi-level, linear mixed model. We find significant negative
effects and insignificant effects depending on our parameter decisions. Finally, we
provide guidance and strategies for social scientists to consider when employing land
cover data.

**_Blended Finance for Nature?_**

<details>
<summary>
Abstract
</summary>
Blended Finance, the use of concessional capital to crowd in private investment, has
emerged as a new paradigm for financing sustainable development. To scrutinise the
economic rationales behind this practice in a dynamic setting, this paper develops an
inter-temporal model of loan provision and tests the implications of blending in
equilibrium. Blending provides optimal structuring of finance when the aim is to ease
a project's credit constraints before it has achieved financial maturity. However, the
benefits of blending subsequently decrease in an investment's private to public pay-
off ratio and seize to exist entirely upon reaching maturity. Projects with significant
externalities may never reach financial maturity, conditional on the extent to which
commercial investors can monetise them. In these cases, grants and interest rate
subsidies promise higher societal returns over the project's lifecycle.
