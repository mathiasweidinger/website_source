I am a Research Assistant with the [Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/). My research interests lie at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. I study how people's socio-economic well-being can be meaningfully measured and how these metrics relate to the natural environment.

Most of the research I envision sets out to characterize the causal effects of environmental threats -- like floods, tropical storms or Climate Change -- on people's livelihoods. While these contemporaneous effects are interesting in and of themselves, they can also feed into existing climate models (IAMs) to predict the *future* effects of climate change.

Some of my recent [work](/research) includes estimating the impact of temperature and rain shocks on children's labour supply in rural Nigeria, analyzing graduate student's motives to switch specialization tracks, and comparing the long term benefits of early work with those of education throughout different economic environments. Holding a [BA in European Studies](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/bachelor-european-studies), I have also worked on EU foreign affairs and polarized electoral contests.

Large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). I also like to explore non-traditional data sources, such as satellite imagery or social media contents, that typically lend themselves well to Machine Learning.

When I'm not working, I like to gain some distance from my computer screen. You might find me running a trail in the alps nearby, reading popular science books, watering my plants, enjoying civil debate, or sharing a meal (perhaps a plant-based one) with nice people around me. Before I came to Zurich, I was a Project Assistant at [UNU-MERIT](https://merit.unu.edu) and studied at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl).
