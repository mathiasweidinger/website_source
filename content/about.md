<!--I am a doctoral student at the University of Oxford's [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/). -->

I am a social scientist with a passion for people and the natural world. Since 2023, I work as an Early Career Researcher at the [Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment](https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/). I am also affiliated to [Oxford Net Zero](https://netzeroclimate.org/), the [Institute of New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/mathias-weidinger/), the [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/), and [Climate Compatible Growth](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.com/). Before coming to Oxford, I worked with the [Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/) and studied at [UNU-MERIT](https://www.merit.unu.edu/training/msc-in-public-policy-and-human-development/) and [Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-economic-and-financial-research-track-economic-financial-research). You can view my CV [here](/weidinger_cv.pdf).

My research interests lie at the intersection of environmental and development economics, or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. This means I study how human development and environmental sustainability can reinforce each other in lower- and middle-income country settings. My ultimate goal is to help build an evidence base for policies that strengthen resilience in local communities, invest in biodiversity and ecosystem services, or enable just, pro-poor transitions towards (and beyond) net-zero.

Curiosity, caffeine, and conversation fuel most everything I do. One of my favourite platforms to provide all three of these is the [Oxford Environmental Economics Seminar Series](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/event/environmental-economics) which I help organise. Since large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects, I spend much of my time coding in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Rarely, I write a [blog post](/post) to capture an idea I have, take note of something I would otherwise forget (say, a code snippet), or weigh in on some issue that has recently caught my attention.

In my screen-free time, you might find me [running around outside](/images/ptrun.jpg), learning a new language, cooking, reading, listening to Latin music, or taking pictures of landscapes (with and without people in them).

If any of the above resonates with you, [say hi](/contact)!
