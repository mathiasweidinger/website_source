I am a data enthusiast and social scientist who lives at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. I study how people's economic well-being relates to their natural surroundings, how economic activity transforms the natural environment, and how sustainable development can be achieved. 

Most of the research I envision measures the effects of environmental threats on people's livelihoods in the Global South (and *vice versa*). Since human development relies heavily on ecosystems services, the ultimate goal of my work is to find ways to tackle poverty, hunger, child mortality and the like through investment in environmental quality and effective climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). I also like to explore non-traditional data sources, such as satellite imagery or social media contents, that typically lend themselves well to Machine Learning techniques.

Following my research assistantship with the [Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/), I am currently finalizing my [Degree in Economic and Financial Research](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-economic-and-financial-research-track-economic-financial-research) and applying for doctoral positions. In the past, I worked as a project assistant for online education at [UNU-MERIT](https://merit.unu.edu) and studied at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl).
coding, literature, hiking, and trail running. See my [blog](/post) to read what has been on my mind lately.
