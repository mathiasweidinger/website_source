I am a data enthusiast who works at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. Following a nine month research assistantship with the Development Economics Group at [ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/), I am currently finishing my Research Master's at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-economic-and-financial-research-track-economic-financial-research).

My research explores the linkages between ecosystem services, economic activity, and human development. The ultimate goal of my work is to find ways to tackle poverty, hunger, child mortality and the like through social protection, investment in environmental quality, and effective climate action.

Large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). When I'm not working, I like to learn new languages, listen to music, geek out about coffee, read popular science books, or simply be outdoors.

On this website you can learn more about me and the work I do. I also intermittently write blog posts to capture an idea I have, take note of something I would otherwise forget, or weigh in on a topic that has recently caught my attention.
