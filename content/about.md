I am a Research Assistant with the [Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/). My research interests lie at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. Here is what that means to me as I gradually draw up my research agenda at this early stage in my career.

As we journey through the [Anthropocene](https://www.nature.com/articles/415023a), we humans interact with our natural environment in unprecedented ways and scale. As a species, we are on course to fall below the triple bottom line of social equity, ecological sustainability, and economic profitability. It is clear that we cannot go on trading economic development now for ecological crisis down the line. In fact, I believe that human development can no longer occur *unless* we safeguard the flow of ecosystem services that provides the very basis for human economic activity as we know it.

Serious attempts at improving human lives by fighting hunger, poverty, inequality, disease, or labor exploitation, for example, must now consider these links if they are to succeed in the long run. Therefore, I seek to better understand how people's economic realities - and policies intended to improve them - evolve in relation to environmental threats like air pollution, tropical storms, or climate change. 

Some of my recent [work](/research) includes estimating the impact of temperature and rain shocks on children's labour supply in rural Nigeria, analyzing graduate student's motives to switch specialization tracks, and comparing the long term benefits of early work with those of education throughout different economic environments. Holding a [BA in European Studies](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/bachelor-european-studies), I have also worked on EU foreign affairs and polarized electoral contests.

Large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). When I'm not working, you might find me running a trail, reading popular science books, watering my plants, or cooking.

Before I came to Zurich, I was a Project Assistant at [UNU-MERIT](https://merit.unu.edu) and studied at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl).
