<!--I am a doctoral student at the University of Oxford's [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/). -->

I am a social scientist with a passion for people and the natural world. I work as an Early Career Researcher at the [Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment](https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/) and hold affiliations with [Oxford Net Zero](https://netzeroclimate.org/), the [Institute of New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/mathias-weidinger/) at the [Oxford Martin School](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/), the [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/), and [Climate Compatible Growth](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.com/). Before coming to Oxford, I worked with the [Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/) and studied at [UNU-MERIT](https://www.merit.unu.edu/training/msc-in-public-policy-and-human-development/) and [Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-economic-and-financial-research-track-economic-financial-research).

My research interests lie at the intersection of environmental and development economics, or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. I study how human development and environmental sustainability can reinforce each other in lower- and middle-income country settings. The ultimate goal of my work is to build an evidence base for policies that strengthen resilience in local communities, invest in biodiversity and ecosystem services, or enable just, pro-poor transitions towards (and beyond) net-zero.

Curiosity, caffeine, and conversation with others fuel most everything I do. One of my favourite platforms to provide all three of these inputs is the [Oxford Environmental Economics Seminar Series](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/event/environmental-economics) which I help organise. Since large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects, I spend much of my time coding in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). If any of the above resonates with you, I encourage you to send me an email. I am always looking to brainstorm new ideas, challenge my assumptions, or scope the potential for collaboration over a cup of tea or coffee.

In my screen-free time, you might find me [running around outside](/images/ptrun.jpg), learning a new language, cooking, reading, listening to Latin music, or taking pictures. Here, I write the occasional [blog post](/post) to capture an idea I have, take note of something I would otherwise forget, or weigh in on a topic that has recently caught my attention.
