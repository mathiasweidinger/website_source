I an applied microeconomist who works at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. Following a nine month research assistantship with the Development Economics Group at [ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/), I am currently finishing my Research Master's at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-economic-and-financial-research-track-economic-financial-research).

My research explores the links between ecosystem services, economic activity, and human development. It asks how to efficiently pursue the twin goals of poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability, with a focus on how low- and middle-income countries can efficiently transition their economies towards net zero. Large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/).


When I'm not working, I like to geek out about coffee and [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), learn new languages, listen to music,  read popular science books, or simply enjoy the outdoors. I also write the occasional [blog post](/post) to capture an idea I have, take note of something I would otherwise forget, or weigh in on a topic that has recently caught my attention.
