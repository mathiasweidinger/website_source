I am a quantitative social scientist who works at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. I combine data, mathematical models, and coffee to draw transition pathways towards net zero for low- and middle-income countries. I am particularly passionate about policies that leverage investments in environmental quality to promote the joint goals of environmental sustainability and human development, strengthen resilience in local communities, and make polluters pay.

I work as a Research Assistant in [Climate Compatible Growth](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.com/) at the [Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment](https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/) and also contribute to the [Resilience and Development](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/resilience-development) research theme at the [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/), both at the University of Oxford. 
Previously, I worked with the Development Economics Group at [ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/). I hold a dual Master's degree in Public Policy and Human Development from [UNU-MERIT](https://www.merit.unu.edu/training/msc-in-public-policy-and-human-development/) and a Research Master's in Economics from [Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-economic-and-financial-research-track-economic-financial-research).

Large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

Curiosity and caffeine fuel most everything I do. I'm passionate about sourcing and brewing high-quality coffee for myself and the people around me while we brainstorm new ideas and challenge each others mindsets in conversation. I am also a self-certified geek when it comes to [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), languages (human and programming), and music. In my screen-free time, you might find me [running](/images/ptrun.jpg), cooking, or [taking pictures](https://www.instagram.com/el_suquito/) of the world around me.

Here, I write the occasional [blog post](/post) to capture an idea I have, take note of something I would otherwise forget, or weigh in on a topic that has recently caught my attention.
