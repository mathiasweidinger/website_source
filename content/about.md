I am a data enthusiast and social scientist who lives at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. I study how people's economic well-being relates to their natural surroundings, how economic activity transforms the natural environment, and how sustainable development can be achieved. 

Most of the research I envision measures the effects of environmental threats on people's livelihoods in the Global South (and *vice versa*). Since human development relies heavily on ecosystems services, the ultimate goal of my work is to find ways to tackle poverty, hunger, child mortality and the like through investment in environmental quality and effective climate change mitigation and adaptation.

My latest project is entitled "More Trees, Less Poverty?". It puts to scrutiny the claim that the presence of forests and trees in low-income rural communities yields positive economic outcomes in addition to environmental ones. Some of my earlier [work](/research) includes estimating the impact of climate change on the incidence of agricultural child labor and comparing horizontal inequality metrics across groups, indicators and countries. Holding a [BA in European Studies](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/bachelor-european-studies), I have also worked on EU-ACP development cooperation, inter-parliamentary diplomacy, and constitutional engineering in ethnically divided electorates.

Large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). I also like to explore non-traditional data sources, such as satellite imagery or social media contents, that typically lend themselves well to Machine Learning techniques.

Following my research assistantship with the [Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/), I am currently finalizing my [Degree in Economic and Financial Research](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-economic-and-financial-research-track-economic-financial-research) and applying for doctoral positions. In the past, I worked as a project assistant for online education at [UNU-MERIT](https://merit.unu.edu) and studied at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl).

When I'm not working, I like to gain some distance from my computer screen. The [ABC of things I like](/post/2022-08-16-abc-of-things-i-like) lists some of my favorite pass times. Expect to read more about them and other topics on my [blog](/post).
