I am a quantitative social scientist who works at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. I combine data, mathematical models, and coffee to study how human development and environmental sustainability can reinforce each other in lower- and middle-income countries. I am particularly excited about policies that strengthen resilience in local communities, invest in biodiversity and ecosystem services, or enable just, pro-poor transitions towards (and beyond) net-zero. Large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

I work as an early career researcher at the University of Oxford, where I serve as a Research Assistant in [Climate Compatible Growth](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.com/) at the [Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment](https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/) and in the [Global Finance and Economy](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/global-finance-and-economy) group at the [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/). I also hold affiliations with [Oxford Net Zero](https://netzeroclimate.org/) and the [Institute of New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/mathias-weidinger/) at the [Oxford Martin School](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/). Before coming to Oxford, I worked with the [Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/) and studied at [UNU-MERIT](https://www.merit.unu.edu/training/msc-in-public-policy-and-human-development/) and [Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-economic-and-financial-research-track-economic-financial-research).

Curiosity, caffeine, and interactions with others fuel most everything I do. Feel free to reach out if you would like to brainstorm new ideas, challenge my assumptions, or scope the potential for collaboration over a cup of tea or coffee. As one of the co-conveners of the [Oxford Environmental Economics Seminar Series](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/event/environmental-economics) and the Smith School Research Seminars, I'd also be happy to receive your input or feedback. In my screen-free time, you might find me outdoors [trail running](/images/ptrun.jpg) or hiking, cooking, reading, listening to Latin music, or taking pictures of the world around me. Here, I write the occasional [blog post](/post) to capture an idea I have, take note of something I would otherwise forget, or weigh in on a topic that has recently caught my attention.

**I am applying for doctoral programmes starting 2025-2026.**
