Here is what that means for my research agenda at this early stage in my career.

As we journey through the [Anthropocene](https://www.nature.com/articles/415023a), our species interacts with its natural habitat in a number of unprecedented ways. Since the industrial revolution, human life on earth has prospered like never before. On average, we grow older, live healthier lives, are more educated, and enjoy greater freedom to decide our on fates than ever before. Of course, even today, life quality is not distributed equally. Most of our new-found freedoms are predominantly enjoyed by those living in the world's high income countries. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is still striving to enter a state of abundance. Given our vast amounts of knowledge and resources, it is all the more sobering to see human misery from hunger, poverty, armed conflict, and treatable diseases prevail in the 21st century. 

Beyond this massive gap in freedoms that are being experienced across the world, better living standards have also come at the cost of environmental and planetary health. Due to our outdated ways of production - most obviously our heavy dependence on fossil fuel combustion - we are now well on course to fall below the triple bottom line of social equity, ecological sustainability, and economic profitability. It is clear that we cannot go on trading economic development now for ecological crisis later. Nor can we hope to curb global inequality by use of the same strategies that led to rapid improvements in today's high-income countries in the past.

In fact, I believe that human development can no longer occur *anywhere* unless we ensure the steady flow of ecosystem services that provide the very basis for human economic activity, prosperity, and progress as we know it. Serious attempts at improving human lives by fighting hunger, poverty, inequality, disease, or labor exploitation, for example, must now consider these links if they are to succeed in the long run.
