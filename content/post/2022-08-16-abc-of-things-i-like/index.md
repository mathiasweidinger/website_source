A is for **[Attersee](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Attersee/@47.8700676,13.4691058,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4774026b824bb8a5:0xe36f3288ce6ad4f9!8m2!3d47.8708161!4d13.5480642)**. The crystalline waters of this Austrian lake with their ever-changing hue of navy blue, indigo and forest green and a scent of earthy freshness were the backdrop to the first 19 years of my life. Although I no longer live nearby, there are few things I would rather do on a hot summer day than to take a dip into the blue where I first learned to swim. On cooler days, one can ascend to hell instead...the mountains of hell or *Hoellengebirge* offer some of the most scenic views you will ever see.

C is for **Coffee**. This one needs no introduction. I have had an intense relationship with coffee for many years now. During my studies it served mostly as a badly needed boost for lonely, long study nights at the library - or a pick me up the morning after. During the first two years of my undergrad, in particular, I spent more money at [Bandito Espresso](https://www.bandito-espresso.com/) than I am willing to admit -  check them out, they are absolutely wonderful! Even so, in an effort to curb my spending I bought a coffee filter to get started with home brewing. Nowadays, I love my Espresso machine as much as my filter carafe. Coffee has also matured as a hobby for me; beyond the daily fix of caffeine, I love to geek out about the science behind flow rates, grind size, brewing temp, pressure, and see how all of the parameters are reflected in the flavor profile in my cup. Recently, I have been loving lightly roasted beans for espresso because of the unusual fruity flavors - think mango, tangerine, or green apple.

M is for **Mate**, a tea prepared from the leaves of *Ilex Paraguariensis*, or *Hierba Mate* (sometimes *Yerba Mate*). Both the beverage and the plant, which is native to South America, contain caffeine. While Mate is often considered the national drink of Argentina, it is also popular in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil. The ice cold variety of this drink is known as *Terere*. The dried and crushed leaves of Mate are placed inside a homonymous gourd or wooden vessel, shaken to get rid of any fine particles, steeped in hot water (around 70 degrees C is perfect), and then sipped through a metal filter straw called *Bombilla*. 

There are a few things I really enjoy about *Mate*. Its effect is stimulating - not unlike coffee - but it lasts for hours and only mellows down gradually. I prefer this to the sudden drop I sometimes experience after a few cups of joe. The taste of Mate is perhaps an acquired one - it is bitter and earthy, complex and harsh at first. As the vessel is repeatedly refilled with hot water the texture and flavor change. Everything starts to become more smooth and refreshing. The main reason I am in love with Mate, though, is it's social component. While I do occasionally drink it by myself, it is certainly a drink to be enjoyed in company. There is a ritual to this: the host prepares the Mate and takes the first sips which tend to be rather harsh and bitter. After that, the vessel is passed around and everyone is having a good time. Fun fact - if you are in love with someone, you can let them know by sugaring the Mate before passing it on to them.

M might also stand for Mountains -  see H, T, and V.
