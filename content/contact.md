I'd love to hear from you. You can send me an email at [mathias.weidinger@gmail.com](mailto:mathias.weidinger@gmail.com) or [book a meeting](https://calendly.com/mathias-weidinger/30min) if you prefer an in-person conversation.

I'm always looking for interesting chats. Let's brainstorm new ideas, challenge our assumptions, or scope the potential for collaboration over a cup of tea or coffee.

I check my inbox and reply to emails 1-2 times a day, but sometimes life gets in the way. Please follow up if I haven't replied within a couple of days.
