I am a quantitative social scientist who works at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or [envirodevonomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.1.5) for short. I combine data, mathematical models, and coffee to understand how human societies and the natural environment relate to one another. I do research so that policies towards decarbonisation and conservation can be informed, effective, and fair - in particular by shifting the cost to polluters while lifting people out of poverty and strengthening global resilience through investments in environmental quality and adaptation.

I work as a Research Assistant in [Climate Compatible Growth](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.com/) at the [Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment](https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/) and also contribute to the [Resilience and Development](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/resilience-development) research theme at the [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/), both at the University of Oxford. Previously, I worked with the Development Economics Group at [ETH Zurich](https://dec.ethz.ch/). I hold a dual Master's degree in Public Policy and Human Development from [UNU-MERIT](https://www.merit.unu.edu/training/msc-in-public-policy-and-human-development/) and a Research Master's in Economics from [Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-economic-and-financial-research-track-economic-financial-research).

I am particularly passionate about policies that leverage investments in environmental quality to enhance human well-being in an effort to draw optimal transition paths for low- and middle-income countries towards net zero and address the twin goals of environmental sustainability and human development. Large data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and occasionally dabble with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

Coffee and curiosity fuel pretty much everything I do. As a result, I am passionate about sourcing and brewing sustainable, high-quality coffee for myself and the people around me. I also self-identify as a geek when it comes to [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), languages (human and programming), and the world as a whole really. In my screen-free time, you might find me [running]("/images/ptrun.jpg"), cooking, or [taking pictures](/lens) of the world around me. I also write the occasional [blog post](/post) to capture an idea I have, take note of something I would otherwise forget, or weigh in on a topic that has recently caught my attention.
